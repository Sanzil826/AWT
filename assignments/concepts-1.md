## Git Basics
1. **init**: This command is used at the beginning of the project. This is neccessary because this command creates a hidden file `.git` which helps in tracking changes.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. **add**: This command is used to add changed files and folders. `git add .` adds all changed files or mentioning file names will only add specfic files.
    ```bash
    git add fileName
    ```

3. **commit**: This command saves a permanent snapshot with a message. It lets Git know what changed and when.
    ```bash
    git commmit -m "commit message"
    ```

4. **push**: This command sends the local commit to a remote repository. It uploads the changes to the git repository.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

5. **pull**: This command is use to fetch changes from the the git repository. 
    ```bash
    git pull origin branch-name
    ```

6. **clone**: This command is used when creating a copy of an existing repository.
    ```bash
    git clone repository-url
    ```

7. **branch**: In Git, branches are the copies of a project where multiple people can work together without affecting one another. `git branch` is used to create a new branch.
    ```bash
    git branch branch-name
    ```

## Callback Function
